(\project_{pizza}(
  (\project_{name}
    \select_{age < 24}
      Person)
   \join Eats)
\diff
\project_{pizza}(
  (\project_{name}
    \select_{age >= 24}
      Person)
   \join Eats))
\union
((\project_{pizza}
  \select_{price < 10} Serves)
\diff
(\project_{pizza}
  \select_{price >= 10} Serves)
);
